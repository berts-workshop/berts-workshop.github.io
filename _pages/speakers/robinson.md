[**Danielle Maddix Robinson**](https://dcmaddix.github.io/) is a senior applied scientist at AWS AI Labs. She received her Ph.D. in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University in 2018 under the supervision of Professor Margot Gerritsen, where she worked on finite volume averaged-based methods for nonlinear porous media flow. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with the highest honors in Applied Mathematics in 2012 and received a Master of Science from Stanford University in 2015. Her research is focused on deep learning models for probabilistic time series forecasting ([Chronos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07815), [GluonTS](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v21/19-820.html)) and physics-constrained machine learning models ([PreDiff](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/f82ba6a6b981fbbecf5f2ee5de7db39c-Abstract-Conference.html)) as part of the DeepEarth team.
