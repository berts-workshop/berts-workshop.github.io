[**Zoe Piran**](https://www.zoepiran.com/en/latest/) is currently a post-doc at Genentech and Stanford, hosted by Aviv Regev and Jure Leskovec. She holds a Ph.D. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where she worked on decoding cellular identities in single-cell data to explore axes of biological variation. Her research aims to develop tools that will provide a deeper biological understanding by merging advancements in single-cell genomics and machine learning, integrating the time evolution in the analysis, like with [MOSCOT](https://moscot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a framework to map cells through time and space (see the corresponding [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08453-2#citeas)).
