[**Mingsheng Long**](https://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/) is a Tenured Associate Professor at Tsinghua University, where he received his Ph.D. degree in 2014. He was a visiting researcher at UC Berkeley from 2014 to 2015. His research is dedicated to transfer learning, foundation models, and scientific machine learning. He is the leader of the Tsinghua Machine Learning Group which is interested in powering machine learning for representation, perception, prediction, and generation of big data with a good tradeoff between accuracy, efficiency, generalizability, and transferability. His team has contributed several famous time series methods, such as [iTransformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06625), [Timexer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19072), [Timesnet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02186), and [Sundial TSFMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00816), which demonstrate top performance on the [TSLib leaderboard](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library).
