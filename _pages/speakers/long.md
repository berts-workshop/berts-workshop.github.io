[**Mingsheng Long**](https://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/) is currently a tenured associate professor at Tsinghua University. He received his PhD degree from Tsinghua University in 2014 and was a visiting researcher at UC Berkeley from 2014 to 2015. His research is dedicated to transfer learning, foundation models, scientific learning, and world models. He is the leader of the Tsinghua Machine Learning Group which is interested in powering machine learning for representation, perception, prediction, and generation of big data with a good tradeoff between accuracy, efficiency, generalizability, and transferability. His team has contributed several famous time series methods, such as [iTransformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06625), [Timexer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19072), [Timesnet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.02186), and a recent family of [Sundial TSFMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00816), that are among the best models for long-term forecasting (see the [leaderboard](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library)).
