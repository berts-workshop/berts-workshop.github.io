[**Valentina Zantedeschi**](https://vzantedeschi.com/) is a Senior Research Scientist at ServiceNow, an Adjunct Professor at Laval University of Quebec, and a member of the ELLIS society. Her research focuses on building ML models that are inherently interpretable via latent discrete structures, with applications in remote sensing, time-varying modeling, and causal discovery. Previously, she was a post-doctoral researcher at INRIA and University College London, and a researcher at the European Space Agencyâ€™s funded FDL research accelerator, where she developed weather forecasting and change detection AI models. Valentina holds a PhD from Jean Monnet University (France) and received the best thesis award in 2019 from the French Society for AI (AFIA). She is a core contributor to [Lag-Llama](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08278), an open-source foundation model for probabilistic time series forecasting and a benchmark for forecasting with contextual information ([CiK benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18959)).
