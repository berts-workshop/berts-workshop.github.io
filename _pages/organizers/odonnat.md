[**Ambroise Odonnat**]([https://tommoral.github.io/about.html](https://ambroiseodt.github.io/)) is a Ph.D. student between Huawei Noah's Ark Lab and Inria, jointly supervised by Ievgen Redko, Romain Tavenard, and Laetitia Chapel. He obtained his Masterâ€™s degree at ENS Paris-Saclay in 2023 from the Mathematics, Vision, and Machine Learning (MVA) program. He also holds an engineering degree from Ecole des Ponts ParisTech in mathematics and computer science. His research interests include better understanding and empirically improving transformers under distribution shift, and the optimization of neural networks. The end goal is to improve transformers' robustness and interpretability for downstream tasks, such as time series forecasting (e.g., [SAMformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10198)). He is a contributor of [Skada](https://scikit-adaptation.github.io/), a Python library for domain adaptation.
