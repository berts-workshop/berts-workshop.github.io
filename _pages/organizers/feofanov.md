[**Vasilii Feofanov**](https://vfeofanov.github.io/) is a senior research scientist at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab and a member of the Time Series Research team. His current research focuses on transformers for time series, unsupervised analysis of pre-trained models, and self-training algorithms. Previously, he completed his Ph.D. under the supervision of Massih-Reza Amini and Emilie Devijver, working on theoretical and practical aspects of semi-supervised learning. Dr. Vasilii Feofanov worked on supervised baselines on par with current TSFMs ([SAMformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10198)), led the project on training a well-calibrated TSFM for classification ([Mantis](https://huggingface.co/paris-noah/Mantis-8M)), studied adaptation of TSFMs to the multivariate case ([AdaPTS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10235)), and [OOD generalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06368).
