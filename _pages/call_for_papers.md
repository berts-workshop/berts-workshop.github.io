We welcome researchers working in the field of time series analysis to submit their latest original research work to the NeurIPS 2025 workshop on **Recent Advances in Time Series Foundation Models:
Have We Reached the BERT Moment?**
- Submission link: **[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Workshop/BERT2S)**
- Submission deadline: (**To be confirmed soon**), Aug 22, 2025 (11:59 pm AoE)
- Acceptance notification: (**To be confirmed soon**), Oct 1, 2025 (11:59 pm AoE)
- Camera ready deadline: (**To be confirmed soon**), Nov 19, 2025 (11:59 pm AoE)

## Instructions

We invite submissions in the form of short papers (up to **4 pages**). Additional pages containing references and appendices are allowed, but reviewers do not have to take the appendices into account during the review. Submissions must be formatted following this **[LaTeX style template](../assets/zip/bert2s_workshop_latex_template.zip)** and submitted as a single `.pdf` file on **[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Workshop/BERT2S)**. Submissions must be anonymized, along with any supplementary material, to ensure a proper_double-blind_ review process. Papers that exceed the page limit or that are not properly anonymized will be desk-rejected without review. There will be no rebuttal phase, and final decisions will be solely based on the reviews. Rejected or withdrawn submissions will not be made public. Authors of accepted submissions will be able to present a poster, and 4 selected submissions will be invited for oral talks of 15 minutes. 

This workshop is **non-archival**; as such, we welcome original work, but also papers currently under review in another venue. If authors want to submit a paper that has already appeared in a journal, conference, or workshop, it should be reasonably extended. 

## Main Topics

In line with the motivation of this workshop, we will solicit contributions related but not limited to the following broad topics:

1. **Benchmarking Foundation Models in Time Series**.
    - Proposals for new benchmarks and datasets with a significant performance gap compared to simpler models.
    - Criteria and metrics for robust benchmarking of time series models, with a focus on OOD generalization.
2. **Scaling Laws and Efficiency in Time Series Models**.
    - Investigating the scaling laws in TSFMs, especially for classification and multivariate forecasting.
    - Understanding the efficiency of TSFMs across different architectures, sizes of models and pre-training datasets.
3. **Evaluating Transferability and Adaptability of Foundation Models**.
    - Techniques for assessing the adaptability of foundation models in new or evolving time series environments.
    - The role of data diversity and pretraining in improving model transferability across time series tasks.
4. **Leveraging Foundation Models of Other Modalities for Time Series**.
    - FMs trained on other data modalities that are applied to time series.
    - Techniques used for the representation alignment of the different data modalities.
5. **Unsupervised Analysis and Performance Estimation of TSFMs**.
    - Predicting the efficiency of TSFMs on new previously unseen datasets.
    - Estimating the calibration and the uncertainty of TSFMs.
6. **Industrial Benchmarking of TSFMs**.
    - Usability of TSFMs for complex real-world problems.
    - Domain-specific analysis of TSFMS.


## Reviewer Guidelines

We follow the [reviewer guidelines for TMLR](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/acceptance-criteria.html).

> The acceptance decision for a submission is based on the answers to the following questions:
> 
> **Are the claims made in the submission supported by accurate, convincing and clear evidence?**   
> 
> This is the most important criterion. This implies assessing the technical soundness as well as the clarity of the > narrative and arguments presented. Papers with large gaps between claims and evidence must be rejected. 
> 
> - Papers presenting a new method/model with a reasonable proof of concept should be seen as satisfying this criterion. 
> - Papers solely presenting empirical analysis should present rigorous comparisons before making general claims. 
> 
> **Would at least some individuals in this workshop’s audience be interested in knowing the findings of this paper?**    
> 
> This is arguably the most subjective criterion, and therefore needs to be treated carefully. Generally, a reviewer that is unsure as to whether a submission satisfies this criterion should assume that it does. Crucially, it should not be used as a reason to reject work that isn't considered “significant” or “impactful” because it isn't achieving a new state-of-the-art on some benchmark. Nor should it form the basis for rejecting work on a method considered not “novel enough”, as novelty of the studied method is not a necessary criteria for acceptance. We explicitly avoid these terms (“significant”, “impactful”, “novel”), and focus instead on the notion of “interest”. If the authors make it clear that there is something to be learned by some researchers in their area from their work, then the criterion of interest is considered satisfied.
> 
> Papers should be accepted if they meet these criteria, even if the contribution or significance of the work is modest. 
> 
> Papers that should not be accepted include 
> - papers that make bold statements unsupported by empirical or rigorous evidence,
> - papers that aren’t clearly written,
> - papers that incorrectly claim novelty over existing published work, and
> - papers that merely re-implement an idea that has already been reproduced before.

### Review Format

A review should have the following content.

**Summary of contributions**: Brief description, in the reviewer's words, of the contributions and new knowledge presented by the submission.      
**Strengths and weaknesses**: List of the strong aspects of the submission as well as weaker elements (if any) that you think require attention from the authors.     
**Suggestions**: Any suggestions to improve the paper for future versions.
